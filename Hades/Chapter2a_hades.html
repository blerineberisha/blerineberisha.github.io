                “Why are we here again?”, Dionysos asks after I had just
                explained to them what happened. “There were tiny red dotted
                stains on the floor where Zeus’ lightning was stolen, so we’re
                one of the suspect groups”, Hephaestus answers for me. “Yes”, I
                confirm, “now, moving onto the questions.. Where were you when
                the lightning was stolen?” “Last night I was meeting with
                Aphrodite”, Ares counters. I raise my eyebrow and smirk
                slightly, while Hephaestus clenches his fists. “Dearest Ares.. I
                never said when it happened.” His face turns red and Hephaestus
                relaxes a little. “Well,” Ares starts, “Aphrodite and I heard
                noises from Zeus’ room, but naturally we assumed it was just him
                and one of his … lovers going wild.” “Yeah,” Hermes says, “I saw
                Aphrodite and Ares met up at the main palace. I was delivering
                .. a little something for Zeus.” Taking notes of everything, I
                nod and observe the group. “So what were you doing,
                Hephaestus?”, I see him tense up again.
                “Iwas-Iwasworkinginmyshopalldaylong”, he mumbles, stumbling over
                his own words. “Alright, Hephaestus”, I say and he grunts. “So,
                Dionysos, that leaves you.” “Well”, Dionysos chuckles. “I don’t
                even remember what I did five minutes ago! I do think, however,
                I’d recall stealing lightning”, Dionysos smirks. Suddenly a
                flask appears in his hand. “Never have I ever been investigated
                for theft”, he says before taking another, long sip. “Um...”, I
                clear my throat. “Thank you for your time, gentlemen. I’ll let
                you know if there’s anything else I need”, I say before leaving.
