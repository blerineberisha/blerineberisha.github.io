                “So you don’t remember anything at all?”, I ask Dionysos. He
                just shakes his head and giggles. “Nothing!”, he exclaims and
                another flask appears. I snap it out of his hand. “Ooh, you’re
                joining? You’re more fun than I thought you wer-” I interrupt
                him by throwing the flask away. “Hey, I was gonna drink that!”,
                he says sadly. “You can drink later, first you need to think.”
                He sighs and mumbles “alright, but you owe me one!” A few
                seconds later his face lights up. “There were sea nymphs in my
                bed when I woke up! Maybe they remember something that can prove
                my innocence!” He takes out his phone and dials a number. “Hello
                darling! What did we do last night?”, he asks. “Well”, she
                starts, sounding very nervous. “At first we just drank and then
                we went to your room to-” “After that!”, Dionysos interrupts
                her, sounding very panicked and sober all of a sudden. “Oh, you
                fell asleep instantly. By the way, you snore really loudly. Do
                you have anything for that? Maybe you should get that checked
                out, I don’t think that’s normal. Maybe you should pay Hygieia a
                visit, I think she could-”, the sea nymph is once again
                interrupted. This time by Dionysos hanging up on her. “I think
                that’s enough. Thanks, Dionysos.”
