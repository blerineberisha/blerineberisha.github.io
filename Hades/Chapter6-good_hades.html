                You accuse Athena and you’re now standing in court, trying to
                prove that it’s the other one. “Do you think it’s believable he
                was in court all day? Documents can easily be faked, especially
                as the king of the underworld”, Athena explains. “I was able to
                clear every God and Goddess, but not our dearest Hades here.” “I
                don’t like having to accuse Hades”, Athena continues. “But since
                I was able to clear everyone, Hades’ cover story just seems the
                most unlikely to me”, she finishes. “And that is why I think
                that you should punish Hades for stealing the lightning. Thank
                you.” Now it’s my turn. “Now, information I’ve deliberately kept
                to myself is that there is video evidence of that very day,
                since the trials are recorded”, I defend myself. “Besides that,
                there is an entire protocol and transcript to the trial and
                there are dozens of witnesses, as I had already told Athena”, I
                look her in the eyes. “What I know about Athena, though”, I
                continue, feeling like a lawyer. “What I know about Athena,
                though, is that she lied in the interview we had.” I can hear
                several gasps. “Now, in our interview, Athena told me that she
                went to visit some Gods that day and could be cleared for the
                entire day…” I can feel the anticipation in the room. “ … but
                what I heard from another interview, Athena only checked in on
                them really quickly and cannot be accounted for, for more than a
                few minutes”, I finish. “And that very lie, is why I think we
                should punish Athena for stealing the lightning. Thank you.”
                <p>Congratulations! Thanks to your great detective skills, the Gods
                are on your side and Athena was punished for her crime!
