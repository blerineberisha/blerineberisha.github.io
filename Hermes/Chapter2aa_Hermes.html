              “Why are we here again?”, Dionysos asks after I had just explained to them what happened. 
“There were tiny red dotted stains on the floor where Zeus’ lightning was stolen, so we’re one of the suspect groups”, Hephaestus answers for me.
“Yes”, I confirm, “now, moving onto the questions.. Where were you when the lightning was stolen?” 
“You should already know”, Ares replies, smirking. 
“I do, but refresh my memory?”, I ask. 
“Well,” Ares starts, “Aphrodite and I heard noises from Zeus’ room, but naturally we assumed it was just him and one of his … lovers going wild.”
I can see Hephaestus tense up as Ares retells his story.
“Since I saw you and Aphrodite meet at the main palace, that makes sense”, I reply, taking notes, but also sketching on the side of my notepad.
“So what were you doing, Hephaestus?”, I see him tense up again. 
“Iwas-Iwasworkinginmyshopalldaylong”, he mumbles, stumbling over his own words. 
“Alright, Hephaestus”, I say and he grunts. 
“So, Dionysos, that leaves you.” 
“Well”, Dionysos chuckles.
“I don’t even remember what I did five minutes ago! I do think, however, I’d recall stealing lightning”, Dionysos smirks. Suddenly a flask appears in his hand. “Never have I ever been investigated for theft”, he says before taking another, long sip.
“Pass the flask, Dee”, I smile as Dionysos passes me the flask. I take a long sip and hand him back his flask.
“Thank you for your time, gentlemen. I’ll let you know if there’s anything else I need”, I say before leaving.
