                “Okay, so”, Apollo starts. 
                “I get why everyone else is here, but.. why am I? Do I look like I need to steal lightning? I’m the God of the sun! I’m dashing already!”, he looks around as if to seek approval. 
                “You’re my brother, but obviously I got all the brains”, Artemis sighs, but still looking at him threateningly. 
                “So”, I interrupt them. “Where were you the night of the theft?” 
                “I was with Ares last night”, Aphrodite says confidently. 
                “Pretty sure Hermes saw us at the main palace”, she continues. 
                “So how do you know when it happened?”, I ask.
                She turns red. “Well, we heard noise from Zeus’ room. We thought it was just him and one of his lovers, but I guess it wasn’t him after all”, she finishes. 
                “Why are you interrogating us though?”, Artemis asks. 
                “I found a flower petal at the crime scene and thought I’d question you”, I reply. Artemis nods. 
                “I was training all day long. At one point my idiot brother showed up for an archery competition, but that’s it”, Artemis explains. I cringe a little, since Apollo is a friend of mine.
                “I was on a date with a forest nymph until I went to have the competition”, Apollo says, rolling his eyes. 
                “As you know already”, he adds, too. 
                Artemis whispers: “you’re only pissed cause I won.”
                “So that leaves me”, Demeter sighs. 
                “I spent the entire day with Persephone, you can ask Hades if you want to. He knows.”
                “Okay, thank you”, I reply and take notes of the interrogation so far and sketch on the side of my notepad.
                “Thank you for your time, ladies and Apollo. I’ll let you know if there’s anything else I need”, I say before leaving.
