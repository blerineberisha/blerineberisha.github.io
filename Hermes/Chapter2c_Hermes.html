                “Hey bro”, Poseidon yells out excited. 
                “Good to see you again, wish it was better circumstances though. Bro lost his thunder, aye?”
                “His lightning, actually”, Hades grins. 
                “Don’t think he ever had thunder. It’s good to see you too though.”
                “Unfortunately”, I interrupt Hades and Poseidon, “I’m going to have to ask you where you were the night of the theft, because I found no sign of breaking and entering, so that only leaves his inner circle”, I continue. 
                “Well, I had to take advantage of the waves the last few days, so I went surfing”, Poseidon replies. 
                “How do you know it’s that recent?”, I ask Poseidon. 
                “There hasn’t been any lightning in a while. I know our bro’s mood swings too well at this point, it’s been a little too clear for too long”, he counters. 
                “True”, Hades replies. 
                “Zeus may be mad, but there is some.. routine to his madness”, he continues.
                I nod and take notes. 
                “So where were you, Hades?”, I ask. 
                “There was a soul on trial for putting milk before cereal.”
                I nod in agreement. “I get that. Psychopaths, huh?” 
                Taking notes and sketching on the side of my notepad, I continue with the interrogation.
                “And Hestia where were you?”, she jumps at the sound of her own name. 
                “In my home! Where I feel safe!”, she says very hectically, obviously stressed out. 
                “Tia”, Hera says, touching Hestia’s shoulder. 
                “Calm down, everything’s gonna be f-”, Hestia smacks Hera’s hand away. 
                “Please refrain from touching me!”, she raises her voice. 
                “Alright, alright!”, Hera replies, holding up her hands. 
                “So, I guess that leaves me”, Hera sighs. 
                “I was paying a visit to a mortal wedding and took it upon myself to avenge the wives whose husbands are, to be quite frank, assholes”, she finishes. 
                I nod. 
                “Thank you for your time, ladies, dark lord and aquaman. I’ll let you know if there’s anything else I need”, I say before leaving.
