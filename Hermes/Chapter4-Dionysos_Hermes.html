                “So you don’t remember anything at all?”, I ask Dionysos. 
                He just shakes his head and giggles. 
                “Nothing!”, he exclaims and another flask appears. 
                I snap it out of his hand. 
                “Ooh, you’re joining? You’re more fun than I thought you wer-”
                I interrupt him by throwing the flask away. 
                “Hey, I was gonna drink that!”, he says sadly. 
                “You can drink later, first you need to think.”
                He sighs and mumbles “alright, but you owe me one!”
                A few seconds later his face lights up. 
                “There were sea nymphs in my bed when I woke up! Maybe they remember something that can prove my innocence!” He takes out his phone and dials a number.
                “Hello darling! What did we do last night?”, he asks. 
                “Well”, she starts, sounding very nervous. 
                “At first we just drank and then we went to your room to-”
                “After that!”, Dionysos interrupts her, sounding very panicked and sober all of a sudden. 
                “Oh, you fell asleep instantly. By the way, you snore really loudly. Do you have anything for that? Maybe you should get that checked out, I don’t think that’s normal. Maybe you should pay Hygieia a visit, I think she could-”, the sea nymph is once again interrupted. This time by Dionysos hanging up on her. 
                “I think that’s enough. Thanks, Dionysos”, I say.
