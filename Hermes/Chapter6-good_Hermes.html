                You accuse Athena and you’re now standing in court, trying to prove that it’s the other one. 
                “Do you think it’s believable he was on delivery duty all night?”, Athena explains. 
                “I was able to clear every God and Goddess, but not our dearest Hermes here.”
                “I don’t like having to accuse Hermes”, Athena continues.
                “But since I was able to clear everyone, Hermes’ cover story just seems the most unlikely to me”, she finishes. 
                “And that is why I think that you should punish Hermes for stealing the lightning. Thank you.”
                Now it’s my turn.
                “Now, the evidence for my innocence is Zeus himself”, I defend myself.
                “Besides Zeus, there’s also a mortal who can vouch for me and Hera herself”, I look her in the eyes. 
                “What I know about Athena, though”, I continue, feeling like a lawyer.
                “What I know about Athena, though, is that she lied in the interview we had.”
                I can hear several gasps.
                “Now, in our interview, Athena told me that she went to visit some Gods that day and could be cleared for the entire day…”
                I can feel the anticipation in the room. 
                “ … but what I heard from another interview, Athena only checked in on them really quickly and cannot be accounted for, for more than a few minutes”, I finish. 
                “And that very lie, is why I think we should punish Athena for stealing the lightning. Thank you.”
                
                Congratulations! Thanks to your great detective skills, the Gods are on your side and Athena was punished for her crime!
